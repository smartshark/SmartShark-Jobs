Firebase enables easy access from [Android](https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/), [iOS](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/) and the [web](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/). Servers aren't left out; there's also [REST](https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/) support.\n+\n+## URI and Versioning\n+\n+The API is based at https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com.\n+\n+We hope to improve it over time, and may later enable access to private per-user data using OAuth. The changes won't always be backward compatible, so we're going to version the API. This first iteration will live at https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/ and is structured as described below.\n+\n+## Items\n+\n+Stories, comments, Ask HNs and even polls are just items.
